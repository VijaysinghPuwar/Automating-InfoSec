## üîë Lab Objectives
This lab introduced me to the fundamentals of PowerShell by covering:

1. **PowerShell Basics**
   - Launching and navigating the PowerShell environment  
   - Verifying user context (`whoami`) and directories (`pwd`, `Get-Location`)  
   - Creating and managing files with `New-Item`, `attrib`, and `Get-Content`  
   - Example file: `.-nametest1.txt` ‚Üí contains `Hello! World`

2. **Object Operations**
   - Demonstrated how PowerShell treats everything as an object  
   - Used string methods (`.Length`, `.ToLower()`)  
   - Inspected object members using `Get-Member`

3. **Process Information**
   - Listed all active processes with `Get-Process`  
   - Filtered by name prefix (`gps -n w*`)  
   - Stored and terminated Notepad processes using `.Kill()`  
   - Queried processes with IDs ‚â• 10,000 using pipelines

4. **Useful Commands**
   - Explored built-in help (`Get-Help`)  
   - Listed available commands (`Get-Command`)  
   - Investigated properties and methods of the `System.Diagnostics.Process` object

5. **First PowerShell Script**
   - Script to calculate the **sum of handles** for processes starting with "N":
     ```powershell
     $hcount = 0
     foreach ($process in Get-Process -Name n* -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) {
         $hcount += $process.Handles
     }
     $hcount
     ```
   - Saved as `script1.ps1`  
   - Verified with `Measure-Object` for accuracy  

6. **CPU Monitoring Script**
   - Wrote `cputime.ps1` to display the **top 5 CPU-consuming processes**  
   - Output included process ID, name, and CPU usage

## üìù Reflection
- **What I liked:**  
  The lab progressed logically from basic commands ‚Üí object operations ‚Üí scripting. It showed how even simple scripts can be powerful for monitoring and automation.  

- **Challenges:**  
  Faced issues with **execution policies**, requiring a process-scoped bypass to run scripts securely. Learned how PowerShell enforces script execution rules to balance automation with security.  

- **Takeaway:**  
  This lab provided a solid foundation in PowerShell, emphasizing automation for **system administration, performance monitoring, and cybersecurity tasks**.
